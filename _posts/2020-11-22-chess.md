### Concept
I recently gained an interest in chess, and wanted a way to combine my hobby with my career. I came up with the idea of building a chess game in Python. The key features I wanted were pieces that moved like real pieces, the ability to drag and drop pieces, and to create a chess AI to play against.

### Development
I used the *pygame* package to spin up my boardgame, and otherwise mainly used built-in modules to keep track of the board position and determine valid moves. My rudimentary chess AI uses the minimax algorithm as well as basic bitboards for determining the best squares for each type of piece.

### Chess++
After successfully building my initial game in Python, I was unimpressed with the speed of the search algorithm for finding best moves. I did some research and determined that coding the program in C++ could vastly improve computing time, so I studied C++ coding constructs and went to work recreating the game in a new language.

It came out quite well, and both my Python and C++ chess programs can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/Michael-Welch/projects){:target="_blank"}.

### Future Plans
The next steps for this project include adding multi-threading to the computer algorithm search in order to better utilize the CPU and speed up the search process, allowing for deeper searching depths. 

I am also planning to implement a networking solution to embed the game into this website and potentially allow users to play either against the AI or even against other users.
