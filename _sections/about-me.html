<p>I graduated from the <b>University of Connecticut</b> in 2020 
    with a degree in <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b>. 
    I have a concentration in <b>Cyber Security</b> and am looking
    for job opportunities in and around that field. I am currently
    living in Bolton, CT but I love adventure and looking forward to
    going wherever life takes me.
    <br><br>
    I love the outdoors, camping, reading and learning about computers.
    Have a look around and see some of the work I've done recently.
